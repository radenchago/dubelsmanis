# Facemash
As you may know, Zuckerberg once created a website which compare girl with other girls when he was still a student at Harvard. The website was called **Facemash**, unfortunately the website was closed due to people privacy being violated.

The purpose of this project was to recreate **Facemash** minus the girl and stuff so all we have is the website and the algorithm.

I've seen a lot of recreation of Facemash, but most of them is in PHP and other language, I created this one with fully static web technology and use Firebase as a the database.
